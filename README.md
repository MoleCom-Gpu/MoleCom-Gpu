# Molecular Communication Gpu Simulator (a.k.a. Parallel simulation framework for nanonetworking)

 This project is being developed as a CmpE491/492 senior project at Bogazici University. The aim of the project is to develop a powerful parallel simulation framework utilizing the parallel computing power of Graphical Processing Units (GPU). The project is implemented using Torch scientific framework and its CUDA package CuTorch.
 For more details, please refer to documentation of the project. Project presentations and reports are also in the documentation.
## Specifications and Requirements
 In order to run the simulator on a local machine the following are **required**
 * Ubuntu 12+
 * An NVdia GPU supporting CUDA
 * CUDA (please refer to http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/ to install CUDA)
 * Torch Framework (please refer to http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html to install Torch)
